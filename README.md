# statistics_r_projects

This repository contains a set of small, self-contained R data analysis projects created as part of a statistics/data-analysis course. Each subfolder holds the data, an R Markdown (.Rmd) analysis notebook and the rendered PDF output. The focus of the projects is exploratory data analysis, visualization, simple statistical summaries and comparisons â€” not packaged applications.

High-level contents
- demography_analysis: Exploratory analyses of demographic datasets (fertility, expenditure, birth rates, internet usage). Includes CSV data, an R Markdown analysis and a rendered PDF report.
- movie_ratings_and_revenue: Analyses that compare movie ratings to financial performance, with data on box office/financial records and ratings. Contains CSVs, an R Markdown report and PDF output.
- nba_records: A collection of basketball statistics (points, field goals, free throws, minutes played, salaries, game counts) used for trend analysis and player-level summaries. Includes CSVs, an R Markdown analysis and a rendered PDF.

Interpreting the results
- The R Markdown documents combine code and narrative. Figures and tables in the PDFs highlight the main descriptive and comparative findings. Typical outputs you will encounter:
	- Scatterplots and regression lines to show pairwise relationships.
	- Time series or trend plots for variables measured across years/seasons.
	- Boxplots and grouped summaries for comparing distributions.
	- Short written interpretations next to each figure explaining what to notice (e.g., strength/direction of relationships, notable outliers, changes over time).

Where to look next inside the repo?
- Open any subfolder and inspect the `.Rmd` file to read the full narrative and see the code that produced the figures in the accompanying PDF. CSV filenames in each subfolder are the input data for that project's analysis.
