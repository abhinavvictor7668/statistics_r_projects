movie_ratings_and_revenue
- Purpose: Investigate relationships between movie ratings and revenue/financial performance and compare patterns across titles or time. Common analytical pieces:
	- Loading and merging ratings and financial records.
	- Summary statistics for ratings and revenue, distributions and outlier detection.
	- Correlation and comparison analyses (do higher-rated movies consistently earn more?).
	- Comparative plots such as scatterplots, boxplots, and grouped summaries by rating bands or genre (if genre is available in the data).

Files to note:
- `Movie Ratings.Rmd` — analysis notebook with the step-by-step investigation and commentary.
- `Movie-Ratings.pdf` — rendered report containing the narrative, figures, and main takeaways.
- `Financial Records.csv`, `S6-Movie-Ratings.csv`, `Rating comparison.csv` — datasets used for the analyses and comparisons.
